# Global Energy Access Analysis

This R project analyses global and country-level access to electricity and clean cooking fuels using publicly available data. The analysis explores temporal trends, country disparities, and comparisons to global averages.

# Project Overview

The project focuses on the dataset 'data.csv', which provides the number of people with and without access to electricity and clean cooking fuels across countries and years. The dataset is used to:

- Assess global trends in energy access over time.
- Examine disparities in access across countries.
- Compare country-level access to global averages.

# Requirements

This project uses R and the following packages:

- `pacman` (for package management)
- `ggplot2` (for plotting)
- `dplyr` (for data manipulation)
- `tidyr` (for reshaping data)
- `readr` (for reading CSV files)

Install and load the required packages using:

library(pacman)
p_load(ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr)
